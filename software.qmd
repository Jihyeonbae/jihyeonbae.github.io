I was fortunate to be part of a fantastic team for the ''Data Science for Social Good'' program in summer 2024.
We developed an R package [GeoNdxR](https://github.com/uwescience/WaterReuseDSSG2024) that allows R users to build user-interactive website ([water reuse index](https://chayek.github.io/Water-Reuse-Drivers-Index/) as an example)for index creation using their own geospatial data of interest, without any designated server.
